The scripts in this folder are for the analysis of molecular dynamics simulations using a structural alphabet called Protein Blocks.

PBmapclust.pl is the main script. All scripts have an "in-script documentation" to briefly explain what they do and how to execute them.

If you find these scripts useful in your research, please cite:
